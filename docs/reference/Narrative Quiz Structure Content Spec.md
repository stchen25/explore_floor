# Narrative Quiz Structure, Content Spec

Source: FigJam board "Narrative Quiz Structure" (figma.com/board/HP9OFVXI69y7tKaFUJP1Lz), pulled 2026-06-07.

**Purpose.** This document gives the questions, answer choices, category mappings, and flow for two versions of the Explore the Floor interest quiz. We're building both versions to test which style users prefer. This spec covers content and order only. It says nothing about visual design or implementation, and it isn't a recommendation for either.

**Light copyedits.** Sticky-note typos from the board were cleaned in transcription (spelling, apostrophes, "median in" to "median is"). No wording was otherwise changed.

---

## Shared framework

Both versions score the user across the same four interest categories, each tied to a role:

| Category | Role |
|---|---|
| Operate | Operator |
| Repair | Technician |
| Program | Specialist |
| Plan | Integrator |

Scored choices and statements tally toward one or more categories. The category totals drive the shared results experience (described at the end of this doc).

## Version 1: Narrative (FigJam Page 1, "Story line")

One continuous flow in two parts: a short set of intro questions, then a day-in-the-life story. Each question shows a prompt line (when one exists), the question, and its choices. Unless a branch is noted, any answer advances to the next question.

### Part 1: Intro questions

Opening prompt, shown with Q1: **"Let's start with some basic questions..."**

**Q1. Are you planning on going to college?**

| Choice | Category mapping | Branch |
|---|---|---|
| Yes | none | go to Q2 |
| No | none | skip to Q3 |

**Q2. How long?** _(only shown if Q1 = Yes)_

| Choice | Category mapping |
|---|---|
| Little as possible (1-2 years) | none |
| Typical (4 years) | none |
| Long as possible (4+ years) | none |
| Whatever | none |

**Q3. What is the lowest salary you would feel satisfied with?**
Prompt shown with the question: "Keep in mind, the median is $60,000 in the US."

| Choice | Category mapping |
|---|---|
| $40,000 | none |
| $60,000 | none |
| $80,000+ | none |

**Q4. What would you be happy spending your day doing?**
Prompt: **"Workers in robotics do many different things throughout the day..."**

| Choice | Category mapping |
|---|---|
| Doing hands-on work | Operate, Repair |
| Typing on a computer | Program |
| Leading others | Plan |

**Q5. What do you think will bring you the most happiness?**
Prompt: **"Okay, one last thing. What will bring you fulfillment?"**

| Choice | Category mapping |
|---|---|
| Inspiring others | Plan |
| Earning a lot of money | Plan |
| Feeling like I'm helping people | Operate, Repair |
| Solving difficult problems | Program |

Note: Q1-Q3 carry no category mappings on the board. They gather background context (education plans, salary expectations); the board doesn't specify how, or whether, they affect results.

### Part 2: Story

Transition line before Scene 1: **"Alright, let's get started."**

Seven scenes walk through a school day. Every scene has four choices, one per category. _(As built, D-018: the user sorts **each** of the four choices into the three buckets — That's me / Kinda me / Not me — one card at a time, the same structure as Version 2's statement sort. This corrected an earlier "pick one choice" build. See the board-notes section.)_

## Version 2: Direct questions + statement sort (FigJam Page 2)

Three parts in order: starting questions, one mapped multiple-choice question, then a statement sort.

### Part 1: Starting questions

Both answered on a No / Maybe / Yes scale. No category mapping; these gather background context (the board doesn't specify how, or whether, they affect results).

**Q1. Are you planning on pursuing higher education?** No / Maybe / Yes

**Q2. Do you have prior work experience in Robotics and/or tech?** No / Maybe / Yes

### Part 2: Technology question

**Q3. When it comes to working with technology, what do you enjoy doing the most?** (single choice)

| Choice | Category |
|---|---|
| A. Making sure the equipment runs correctly every day | Operate |
| B. Figuring out what is broken and fixing it | Repair |
| C. Building or coding how the technology works | Program |
| D. Deciding how the technology should be used in a larger system | Plan |

### Part 3: Statement sort

Thirty statements presented one after another. For each, the user answers **"That's me" or "That's not me."** Every statement maps to one category (the four columns on the board show the mapping; the user never sees them). The system tallies "That's me" answers by category to produce the result.

Statements are listed here by category for the mapping. Presentation order is not specified on the board; interleave rather than running each category as a block.

**Operate (Operator), 8 statements**

| Statement | Category |
|---|---|
| Advising/tutoring others | Operate |
| Ensuring that your team stays on track | Operate |
| Very detail-oriented when performing a task | Operate |

## Results (shared by both versions)

Two layers, matching the two wireframes on FigJam Page 1.

### Layer 1: Category node map (wireframe 1)

A map of nodes on concentric circles. The four category nodes (Operate, Repair, Program, Plan) are placed by match strength: innermost ring is most like you, outermost ring is least like you. The center is labeled "Recommended titles."

Clicking a category node spawns job-title nodes connected to it, drawn from that category's common job titles (listed below). Clicking a job-title node opens Layer 2.

### Layer 2: Role detail sheet (wireframe 2)

A sheet opens over the map explaining the category that the title belongs to. Content per sheet: role name, description, "Add this Role to your profile" link, job activities, education, common job titles, salary, and a "How you fit" graphic showing the user's four category scores.

## Board notes and open items

- The wireframe sketch shows three job-title nodes per category; the actual title lists above run three to five. The board doesn't say whether to cap at three.
- Two choices carry question marks on the board, meaning the team wasn't settled on them: "IT club" (Version 1, Scene 4) and "Writing code" (Version 1, Scene 6).
- _(Corrected 2026-06-07, verified against the live board.)_ Page 1's two format labels, "Multiple choice" (pink) and "Drag and drop" (blue), are a **color legend**, not unattached: the intro questions are pink (multiple choice, tap-to-select) and all seven story scenes are blue (drag and drop). As built: intro questions are single-select MC. _(Revised D-018:)_ each scene is a **per-choice sort** — the user judges all four choices, sorting each into one of three buckets (drag or tap), the same structure as Version 2's statement sort. This replaced the D-017 "drag your one pick into a zone" build after the team clarified the board's intent.
- _(Corrected 2026-06-07; relabeled D-018.)_ The sort uses **three** buckets — "That's me" / **"Kinda me"** / "Not me" — not two, shared by both the statement sort (Version 2) and the narrative scenes (Version 1). The middle bucket reads "Kinda me" (renamed from "Maybe"). A prior user study asked for a middle option; it currently scores as a no (`MAYBE_WEIGHT = 0`, tunable). See D-017, D-018.
- Page 2 of the board also holds an earlier rough results sketch (robot character, four-category percentage breakdown, "Breakdowns" and "Your roles" panels). The node-map flow described above is the intended results experience.
- _As built:_ results wireframe 1 was reworked into an Obsidian-style node graph — the top-matched role sits front-and-center, the other three sit behind it and swap in on tap, and the active role's job titles branch off the front on connector lines (all titles shown, no cap at three). This replaced an earlier concentric-rings version that read as "funky" (D-017).
