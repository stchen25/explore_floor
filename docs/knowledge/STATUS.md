# Status

**Read this first.** Live snapshot of where the build is. Updated as acceptance criteria clear (by `/phase-check` or by hand). Keep this a snapshot: session-by-session detail lives in the `sessions/` notes, linked below, not inline here.

- **Last updated:** 2026-07-02
- **Current focus:** The single live flow is the **narrative career-discovery quiz** (post Phase-4 strip + Phase-5 three-role pivot; `DATA_MODEL.md` §17, `DECISIONS.md` D-027/D-028): a branching 6-question intro, 7 day-in-the-life bucket-sort scenes, and the dark 5-screen **role-cards results** scoring ARM's three roles (Technician / Specialist / Integrator), plus the standalone `/select` comparator. Step 8 (the dark visual re-architecture, D-029) is **complete and committed** on branch `narrative-v3-realign`; two follow-up polish passes and the quiz-flow legibility pass (D-030) landed on top, and the dead drag path was removed (D-031). Gates green: lint, typecheck, **82 unit (9 files)**, **3 E2E** (`narrative` / `role-select` / `reduced-motion`); both design rubrics PASS.
- **Phase 1 status:** complete — all gates green; design-review passed all four classic screens with no p1/p2 findings. Built in 3 slices: Sort, Results (the conversion screen), Landing reveal + Build beat.
- **Open items:** the step-8 content gaps (match-% line, Technician-as-rung framing, `categoryBreakdown` wiring, a programs set) all landed in Phase C. Remaining open work is catalogued in the `REMAINING_WORK.md` router (D-032): `HANDOFF_GUIDE.md` (ARM/Fivestar post-handoff content + our pre-handoff cleanup), `DESIGN_SYSTEM_RUN.md` (the `rc-design-system` build), and `DEFERRED_DIRECTIONS.md` (v4 polish + open scoring calls).
- **Next up:** the **ecosystem run** (`ECOSYSTEM_RUN.md`, ratified 2026-07-02, D-035) — executed as single-session passes. Passes 1–5 are done: assets rescued; **`@rc/ui` is live** (`caelar/rc-design-system`, tag `v1`); **`robotics_career` is stood up** (`caelar/robotics_career` private) with ARM's six-role Landing and its harness ported; and **Pass 5 (tokenization) is complete** (its main @ `7347f6b` local, its D-006) — every value token-traceable, the dense type folded onto steps `@rc/ui` v1 already ships (no v1.1 bump needed), its `/design-review` tokens + type sections flipped to pass. The two design-intent calls (gold-as-CTA vs teal-acts; red feedback vs no-red status) await Caelan's refinement per its `REFINEMENT_BRIEF.md`. Awaiting Caelan's pushes: the robotics_career Pass-5 commit + the career_dashboard archive tags/branch deletion. Then Passes 6–7 — all feeding the **late-July client handoff** (`HANDOFF_GUIDE.md`). No in-flight build thread in this repo — branch `narrative-v3-realign` is committed and green.
- **Future direction (documented, not built):** ARM's Fivestar deck (Release 4.3) was analyzed vs. our quiz: comparison + four adopted ideas in `ARM_FIVESTAR_COMPARISON.md`, and a **domain-mirror path to the three AI roles** (keep the 3-tier engine, add a physical/digital domain axis, derive 6 roles at results) in `AI_ROLES_INTEGRATION.md` (`DECISIONS.md` D-034). Build deferred; hard rules unchanged until green-lit.

## Harness bootstrap (this session)

- [x] Reconcile cross-doc contradictions (see `DECISIONS.md` 2026-05-29).
- [x] Onboarding substrate: `.mcp.json`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, root `README.md`, `.nvmrc`.
- [x] Knowledge layer scaffolded (`docs/knowledge/`).
- [x] Rubrics authored (`docs/rubrics/`: design-system-compliance, goose-game-aesthetic, motion-quality). _(Point-in-time log — `goose-game-aesthetic` + `motion-quality` were later retired in D-026 and `results-screen` added; the current set is `design-system-compliance`, `results-screen`.)_
- [x] Subagents (`.claude/agents/`: verifier, design-reviewer).
- [x] Skills (`.claude/skills/`: data-author, scene-motion).
- [x] Slash commands (`.claude/commands/`: phase-check, design-review, compound, capture-figma, pull-figma). _(`revise-doc` was ported later in the realignment, D-024.)_
- [x] `.claude/settings.json` permission allowlist.
- [x] `CLAUDE.md` + `ARCHITECTURE.md` updated for the harness.
- [x] Toolchain skills installed — GSAP + Framer Motion skills present (stored in `.agents/skills/`, symlinked into `.claude/skills/`, pinned in `skills-lock.json`).
- [x] Built-in memory mirror written.

## Phase 0 — Scaffold & foundation (complete — 10/10)

_Last `/phase-check`: 2026-05-29 — `verifier` PASS on all gates (lint, typecheck, 30 unit tests, e2e happy-path) and all `DATA_MODEL.md` §15 invariants; re-confirmed post-commit on branch `phase-0-scaffold`. Tailwind v4 (CSS-first `@theme`) adopted instead of v3 — see `DECISIONS.md` D-013. Also fixed the stale ROADMAP §1.4 "Innovator=24" typo → 27 (matches §15 + committed data)._

Acceptance criteria (from `ROADMAP.md` §1):

- [x] `pnpm dev` runs without errors.
- [x] `pnpm lint` passes.
- [x] `pnpm typecheck` passes.
- [x] `pnpm test:unit` passes scoring, assembly, program-selection tests (30 tests, incl. `data-integrity`).
- [x] `pnpm test:e2e` passes the happy-path Playwright test.
- [x] A human can click `/` → `/results` with no console error (e2e asserts zero console errors across the flow).
- [x] Tailwind tokens match the Figma file's variables (spot-check). Brand colors (arm-yellow `#FFB81C`, arm-orange `#F56A00`, arm-blue `#38A5EE`, arm-teal `#117289`) and the type scale (h1 56/64 … small 14/22) in `@theme` match `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §2–§4, which the file owner confirms were pulled from the Design System file's variables. _(A live MCP variable read was attempted but blocked — the `figma` MCP's variable/context tools are selection-based and `get_metadata` served a stale page snapshot; this is a tooling limit, not a value discrepancy.)_
- [x] Figma MCP connects, a read works, one code-to-canvas capture succeeds (Landing captured into the `explore_floor` file — node `6:2`).
- [x] GSAP AI skills installed and discoverable (`gsap-*` packs in `.claude/skills/`, pinned in `skills-lock.json`).
- [x] Every data sanity check from `DATA_MODEL.md` §15 passes (per-archetype sums **B 22 / I 27 / A 25**).

## Phase 1 — Testable flow (complete)

_Last `/phase-check`: 2026-05-30 — `verifier` PASS on all gates (lint, typecheck, 33 unit across scoring/assembly/program/fit/data-integrity, 4 E2E) and all `DATA_MODEL.md` §15 invariants (sums recomputed Builder 22 / Innovator 27 / Architect 25, plus the new role.skillIds-resolves check). `design-reviewer` PASS on all four screens — no p1/p2 findings. Built in 3 reviewed slices on branch `phase-1-flow`._

Acceptance criteria (from `ROADMAP.md` §2):

- [x] A user can complete the full flow (land → sort 24 → build → results). _(Flow completes end to end; the 3-4 min pacing is a human-test observation.)_
- [x] The Sort screen works via mouse, touch, and keyboard. _(Drag + tap; bins are native buttons so Tab/Enter operability remains. The bespoke arrow-key/Enter mechanic was intentionally removed — `DECISIONS.md` D-015. Full keyboard-nav polish is a Phase 3 a11y item.)_
- [x] Results shows believable weighted match scores across all three archetypes. _(E2E asserts displayed % == engine for a 30/24/23 spread.)_
- [x] The compare interaction works (moving the robot / tapping a card swaps the active read). _(E2E `compare.spec.ts`.)_
- [x] Each role card surfaces programs from the mock data. _(top-3 via `selectProgramsForRole`.)_
- [x] All Playwright tests pass, including the compare interaction. _(4/4.)_
- [x] No console errors on any screen. _(happy-path + reduced-motion specs assert zero console errors across the flow.)_
- [ ] **Demoable to the MHCI cohort; survives 5 unmoderated sessions.** _(Human user-test item — for the team to confirm in testing. Build is technically demoable: flow completes, no crashes in automated runs.)_

## Phase 2 — Feel pass — superseded (documented cut)
The original Phase 2 was the conveyor "feel pass" (sound, robotic-arm choreography, the build beat). That scene was never built and is the **documented cut** (`REALIGNMENT.md`; `CLAUDE.md` "Phasing"). The live feel work happened instead in the **step-8 dark re-architecture** (see "Next up" above — DONE). Old criteria: `ROADMAP.md` §3.

## Phase 3 — Polish — partly superseded
The polish that applies to the live narrative flow shipped inside step 8 (copy, reduced-motion, dark a11y, Figma sync); the sound/conveyor/robot polish is the documented cut. Remaining polish + conscious deferrals now live in `docs/knowledge/DEFERRED_DIRECTIONS.md`, with ARM-owned gaps in `HANDOFF_GUIDE.md` and the design-system queue in `DESIGN_SYSTEM_RUN.md`. Old criteria: `ROADMAP.md` §4.
