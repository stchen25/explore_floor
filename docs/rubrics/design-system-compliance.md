      - id: gsap-cleanup

Checks whether UI honors the kit-aligned, RC.org-derived design system: brand-exact color, the three-role accents, the preserved type system, the spacing/radius/shadow foundation, and motion discipline. This rubric governs *system conformance* and now also covers motion (folded in from the retired `motion-quality.md`). The visual quality of the high-fidelity results screen is judged by `results-screen.md`. _(The `goose-game-aesthetic.md` scene rubric was retired with the conveyor vision, D-026.)_

## Scope & Grounding

**Personas**
- *Riley (16-18), late-HS training-seeker* — the primary user. Should feel this is a fresh, friendly experience that's still recognizably part of RC.org.
- *Parent over the shoulder* — glances for 30 seconds; the look must read as a real, trustworthy ARM product, not a toy.
- *ARM client reviewer* — checks that brand identity is respected exactly (this is an "evolution, not rebrand").

**Realistic scenarios**
- A node on the narrative results map uses its category's accent (from `categoryAccent.ts`) for the match indicator.
- The fit radar's axes and the node ring read their category accent token, not a hardcoded hex.

**Anti-scenarios (should fail)**
- A component hardcodes `#38A5EE` instead of `text-arm-blue`, or invents a per-screen category color.
- A category is themed with a brand-new color outside `categoryAccent.ts`.
- A neon from the dead Make.md palette resurfaces anywhere.
- A "cool" frosted-glass card appears on Results.
- A physical motion sequence plays regardless of `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## 1. Tokens, not literals
Every reused or semantically named value lives in the `@theme` block in `src/styles/globals.css` (color/type/space/radius) or `/src/lib/motion.ts` (durations/easings). Inline hex and magic pixels are the single most common drift and break the Figma↔code token alignment. **Pass:** `className="text-arm-orange p-space-4 rounded-md"`. **Fail:** `style={{ color: '#F56A00', padding: '23px' }}`.

## 2. Color usage
The kit brand colors are exact and non-negotiable. The three roles are color-coded in one place, `categoryAccent.ts`: **technician→`arm-gold`, specialist→`arm-blue`, integrator→`arm-teal`**. A screen reads the token, never a hardcoded hex. `arm-gold` is the global brand signature and the primary CTA fill (the Technician `text-arm-gold` accent shares it; reconciled with the kit's teal-led palette in the step-8 results redesign). The Make.md neons are dead. Product is light-mode only. **Fail:** inventing a per-screen role color, or hardcoding `#38A5EE` instead of the `categoryAccent.ts` token. _(The four study categories `operate/repair/program/plan` and the classic Builder/Innovator/Architect archetype accents are the documented cut; D-028 collapsed accents to the three roles.)_

## 3. Typography
Montserrat for headings, Roboto for body, always. Sizes come from the scale (H1 56/64 … body 16/22, small 14/22). Match percentage renders as H2 in the category accent. **Fail:** a display font swapped in ad hoc, or a hand-set `font-size: 19px`.

## 4. Spacing & layout
Use the `space-0..7` scale (4 → 64px) and container tokens (`container-lg` 1248 default; `container-xl` 1500 for the sort scene). **Fail:** `gap: 18px`.

## 5. Radius & elevation
Only `rounded-sm` (4), `rounded-md` (8), `rounded-full`. Two shadow styles (`shadow-card`, `shadow-elev-2`), used sparingly — the playful layer leans on warm fills and soft outlines, not shadow stacks.

## 6. Surface discipline
Surfaces use the kit conventions (white cards on light surface, kit radii, the two soft shadow tiers, used sparingly). The two-layer (foundation vs playful-scene) model is the documented cut: the scene was never built, so no *new* surface should introduce `scene/*` tokens (only the legacy `LandingSceneHint` hero still reads them, grandfathered until the step-8 redesign). No glassmorphism.

## 7. Motion (folded from the retired motion-quality rubric)
Durations (`instant`/`snap`/`glide`/`pour`/`reveal`) and easings (`ease-soft`/`ease-snap`/`ease-physical`) live in `/src/lib/motion.ts` and are read by both engines. The hard rule survives: **a given element + property is owned by exactly one library at a time.** Motion owns React-state/gesture/lifecycle motion (flow-step transitions, the bucket-sort drag, the node-map compare swap); GSAP owns the single Landing `DrawSVG` reveal, inside `useGSAP` with a scope ref (auto-reverts on unmount). `prefers-reduced-motion` is respected globally (a p1). **Fail:** a hard-coded `duration: 0.35`, a bare `gsap.to(selector)` in a component, both engines writing `transform` on one node, or a physical sequence that ignores reduced-motion.

## Application
Run via `/design-review`, which screenshots the running screen and inspects the JSX/Tailwind (and, for motion, observes it live and toggles reduced-motion). Report p1s as blocking, p2s as should-fix, p3s as polish. Cite the offending file:line and the correct token.
