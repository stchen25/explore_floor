# Data Model

This is the schema spec for everything in `/src/data` and the pure helpers in `/src/lib` that consume it. It's the load-bearing doc. Get this right and the rest of the build is structured edits; get it wrong and the experience leaks logic into UI code, which is the failure mode this convention exists to prevent.

The single guiding principle: **data is data, not code.** All content (interest items, weights, role copy, competency wording, programs, robot part mappings) lives here. UI reads it. Logic transforms it. Nothing about the content lives in a component.

---

## 1. Overview

The model has six core entities:

- **InterestItem** — one of the 24 things the user sorts. Carries archetype weights, a round assignment, and a robot-part contribution.
- **Archetype** — Builder, Innovator, Architect. The internal scoring lens. Each maps 1:1 to a Role.
- **Role** — Robotics Technician, Robotics Specialist, Robotics Integrator. ARM's real role taxonomy. Carries competencies, jobs, and pathway framing.
- **Competency** — a specific ARM-framework competency belonging to a role.
- **EssentialSkill** — a shared soft skill from ARM's framework. Used in results copy and program matching.
- **TrainingProgram** — a mock program that builds toward a role and its competencies. The "programs that get you there" content on results.

Plus two runtime structures:

- **SessionState** — the user's in-flight sorting decisions, scores, and robot.
- **ScoreResult** — what the scoring engine produces.

## 2. TypeScript types

All types live in `/src/data/types.ts`.

```ts
// ---------- Archetypes & Roles ----------

export type ArchetypeId = 'builder' | 'innovator' | 'architect';

export type RoleId = 'technician' | 'specialist' | 'integrator';

/** Each archetype maps to exactly one role. */
export const ARCHETYPE_TO_ROLE: Record<ArchetypeId, RoleId> = {
  builder: 'technician',
  innovator: 'specialist',
  architect: 'integrator',
};

export interface Role {
  id: RoleId;
  archetypeId: ArchetypeId;
  name: string;            // "Robotics Technician"
  archetypeName: string;   // "Builder"
  shortDescription: string; // teen-friendly plain language
  pathFraming: string;      // typical educational pathway, plain language
  competencyIds: string[];
  jobs: Job[];
}

export interface Job {
  title: string;
  description: string;     // one-liner, plain language
}

// ---------- Competencies & Skills ----------

export interface Competency {
  id: string;
  roleId: RoleId;
  name: string;            // "PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)"
  plainName: string;       // teen-friendly translation; see section 5
}

export interface EssentialSkill {
  id: string;
  name: string;            // "Critical Thinking"
}

// ---------- Interest items ----------

/** Weights are integers 0-3. 0 = no signal, 1 = light lean, 2 = clear lean,
 *  3 = defining. An item can contribute to multiple archetypes. */
export interface ArchetypeWeights {
  builder: number;
  innovator: number;
  architect: number;
}

export type RoundId = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4;

export interface InterestItem {
  id: string;              // stable identifier, e.g. 'building-or-fixing'
  round: RoundId;
  label: string;           // what the user reads on the card
  weights: ArchetypeWeights;
  robotContribution: RobotContribution;
}

// ---------- Robot ----------

/** A robot has a fixed set of slots. Each kept interest contributes to one
 *  or more of them. The build logic resolves conflicts (last-wins by default;
 *  see section 9). */
export type RobotSlot =
  | 'base'
  | 'body'
  | 'leftArm'
  | 'rightArm'
  | 'head'
  | 'accessory'        // up to N accessories can stack
  | 'decal'            // up to N decals can stack
  | 'colorScheme';

export interface RobotContribution {
  /** Description for designers/authors. Not shown to user. */
  intent: string;
  /** One or more part contributions applied if this interest is kept. */
  parts: RobotPartRef[];
}

export interface RobotPartRef {
  slot: RobotSlot;
  partId: string;          // refs an entry in /src/data/robotParts.ts
}

export interface RobotPart {
  id: string;
  slot: RobotSlot;
  name: string;            // designer-facing label
  svgComponent: string;    // name of the React/SVG component to render
}

// ---------- Programs ----------

export interface TrainingProgram {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'apprenticeship' | 'certificate' | 'degree' | 'bootcamp' | 'workshop';
  duration: string;        // "12 weeks", "2 years", etc.
  rolesServed: RoleId[];
  competencyIds: string[]; // which competencies this program builds
  blurb: string;           // 1-2 sentence description
  url?: string;            // optional, mocked
}

// ---------- Runtime ----------

export type Decision = 'keep' | 'pass';

export interface SessionState {
  currentScreen: 'landing' | 'sort' | 'build' | 'results';
  currentRound: 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4;     // 0 = not started, 4 = sorting done
  decisions: Record<string, Decision>; // keyed by InterestItem.id
  scoreResult: ScoreResult | null;
  robot: RobotState | null;
  currentlyTryingOn: RoleId | null;    // results screen state
  soundEnabled: boolean;
}

export interface RobotState {
  slots: Partial<Record<RobotSlot, string | string[]>>; // partId or array for stacking slots
  isFinalized: boolean;     // true only after completion
}

export interface ScoreResult {
  raw: ArchetypeWeights;            // sum of weights for kept items, per archetype
  matchPercentages: ArchetypeWeights; // 0-100 per archetype, see scoring formula
  primaryArchetype: ArchetypeId;
  primaryRole: RoleId;
  ranking: ArchetypeId[];            // ordered, primary first
}
```

## 3. The 24 interest items

Seeded weights below are **designer defaults** (per PRD section 7). They produce a believable spread. Their per-archetype maxes are Builder 22, Innovator 27, Architect 25. These maxes do not need to match: the scoring engine normalizes each archetype against its own maximum (`raw[A] / max[A] * 100`), so no archetype is structurally favored regardless of its raw ceiling. ARM's dev team owns tuning for production.

Notes for the author of `/src/data/items.ts`:

- Build the array in this order. Round assignments and weights match the table verbatim.
- The "Robot intent" column is a starter description; the actual `parts` array per item refers to `partId`s from the part library (section 7). Pencil in placeholder IDs that match these intents; the SVG components themselves get authored alongside Phase 2 of the build.
- Many cells are zero. The schema requires all three weight fields. Do not omit them.

**Sanity totals (max possible if user keeps every item):** Builder 22, Innovator 27, Architect 25.

## 4. Roles

The three Role objects live in `/src/data/roles.ts`. Below is the canonical content for each. Plain-language descriptions are starter copy; the final copy work is an open question in the PRD.

### `technician` — Robotics Technician (Builder)

- **shortDescription:** "Technicians install, maintain, and repair the robots and equipment that keep factories running. Hands-on, learn-by-doing, real machines."
- **pathFraming:** "Often starts with an apprenticeship or a technical certificate. Many technicians grow into senior tech and shift-supervisor roles, learning on the job."
- **competencyIds:** see section 5.
- **jobs:**
  - Robotics Technician — Installs and repairs the robots on a factory floor.

  - Robotics Consultant — Advises companies on how to use robotics to improve their operations.

## 5. Competencies (real ARM framework)

All entries live in `/src/data/competencies.ts`. The `name` field is the official ARM term. The `plainName` field is a teen-friendly translation used in results copy. Plain names below are starter drafts; final copy is an open question.

### Technician competencies (`roleId: 'technician'`)

## 6. Essential skills

The shared soft-skill list from ARM's framework. Lives in `/src/data/skills.ts`. Used in results to call out cross-cutting strengths the user's sorting revealed.

```
active-listening, adaptability, attention-to-detail, communication,
conflict-resolution, critical-thinking, interpersonal-skills, leadership,
problem-solving, teaming, technical-learning-ability, technology-aptitude,
time-management, work-ethic
```

Each is `{ id, name }` only. No plain-name translation needed; the names are already plain.

## 7. Robot parts library

Lives in `/src/data/robotParts.ts`. Each `RobotPart` references an SVG React component that lives in `/src/scene/robot/parts/`. The library is the **interface between data and visuals**: items reference part IDs, the build logic resolves them to SVG components.

For Phase 0 and 1, parts are placeholder shapes. Phase 2 is when the actual stylized SVG art gets made.

### Slot rules

| Slot | Cardinality | Conflict resolution |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| `base` | 1 | last kept wins |
| `body` | 1 | last kept wins |
| `leftArm` | 1 | last kept wins |
| `rightArm` | 1 | last kept wins |
| `head` | 1 | last kept wins |
| `accessory` | many (cap at 4 visual stacks) | accumulate; order by item id |
| `decal` | many (cap at 3 visual stacks) | accumulate; order by item id |
| `colorScheme` | 1 | derived from dominant archetype after scoring |

### Seed part IDs

Author placeholder entries to match the "Robot intent" column in section 3. Examples:

```
{ id: 'wrench-arm', slot: 'rightArm', name: 'Wrench-tool arm', svgComponent: 'WrenchArm' }
{ id: 'binary-decal', slot: 'decal', name: 'Binary spray', svgComponent: 'BinaryDecal' }
{ id: 'chip-pin', slot: 'accessory', name: 'Chip pin', svgComponent: 'ChipPin' }
{ id: 'clipboard', slot: 'accessory', name: 'Clipboard', svgComponent: 'Clipboard' }
{ id: 'mini-robot-arm', slot: 'accessory', name: 'Mini robot arm', svgComponent: 'MiniRobotArm' }
{ id: 'hardhat', slot: 'head', name: 'Hard hat', svgComponent: 'HardHat' }
{ id: 'magnifier-head', slot: 'head', name: 'Magnifier sensor head', svgComponent: 'MagnifierHead' }
{ id: 'blueprint-roll', slot: 'accessory', name: 'Blueprint roll', svgComponent: 'BlueprintRoll' }
{ id: 'flowchart-decal', slot: 'decal', name: 'Flowchart decal', svgComponent: 'FlowchartDecal' }
...
```

The full set of ~24 parts is authored as items are seeded. Many parts can be reused across items (e.g. the wrench arm could be the contribution for items 1 and 19; that's fine and probably desirable for visual coherence).

### Color schemes

Each archetype has a color scheme defined in `/src/data/colorSchemes.ts`. Final palette is set in `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`. The build logic picks a scheme based on the user's dominant archetype after scoring completes.

## 8. Mock training programs

Lives in `/src/data/programs.ts`. Seed about 6-10 representative programs covering all three role families. Accuracy is not required; structure is. The team can swap these out wholesale without breaking anything.

Seed examples:

```ts
{
  id: 'smart-tech',
  name: 'SMART Robotics Technician Program',
  type: 'certificate',
  duration: '16 weeks',
  rolesServed: ['technician'],
  competencyIds: ['tech-mechanical', 'tech-electrical', 'tech-maintenance', 'tech-plc'],
  blurb: 'A hands-on certificate covering the core skills technicians use day to day.'
}
{
  id: 'nc3-cert',
  name: 'NC3 Robotics Certification',
  type: 'certificate',
  duration: '12 weeks',
  rolesServed: ['technician', 'specialist'],
  competencyIds: ['tech-robot-programming', 'spec-installation', 'spec-safety'],
  blurb: 'Industry-recognized certification that opens doors at hundreds of manufacturers.'
}
{
  id: 'mechatronics-as',
  name: 'Mechatronics Associate Degree',
  type: 'degree',
  duration: '2 years',
  rolesServed: ['technician', 'specialist'],
  competencyIds: ['tech-electronics', 'tech-system-controls', 'spec-sensors', 'spec-vision'],
  blurb: 'Two-year degree blending mechanical, electrical, and programming foundations.'
}
{
  id: 'robotics-engineering-bs',
  name: 'Robotics Engineering BS',
  type: 'degree',
  duration: '4 years',
  rolesServed: ['specialist', 'integrator'],
  competencyIds: ['spec-advanced-programming', 'int-simulation', 'int-modeling'],
  blurb: 'A full engineering degree for the programming and design side of robotics.'
}
{
  id: 'industrial-apprenticeship',
  name: 'Manufacturing Apprenticeship',
  type: 'apprenticeship',
  duration: '2-4 years',
  rolesServed: ['technician'],
  competencyIds: ['tech-mechanical', 'tech-maintenance', 'tech-electrical'],
  blurb: 'Earn while you learn: paid apprenticeship with on-the-job training.'
}
{
  id: 'systems-integration-bootcamp',
  name: 'Automation Integration Bootcamp',
  type: 'bootcamp',
  duration: '8 weeks',
  rolesServed: ['integrator'],
  competencyIds: ['int-process-design', 'int-interop', 'int-visualization'],
  blurb: 'Intensive bootcamp for the system-design and integration side of automation.'
}
```

## 9. The scoring engine

Lives in `/src/lib/scoring.ts`. Pure function, no React, no side effects, fully unit-testable.

### Signature

```ts
export function calculateScores(
  decisions: Record<string, Decision>,
  items: InterestItem[]
): ScoreResult;
```

### Algorithm

1. For each archetype `A` in `['builder', 'innovator', 'architect']`:
   - `raw[A] = sum of items[i].weights[A] for every i where decisions[items[i].id] === 'keep'`
   - `max[A] = sum of items[i].weights[A] for every i in items` (the maximum possible)
   - `matchPercentages[A] = round(raw[A] / max[A] * 100)` clamped to integer
2. `primaryArchetype = archetype with the highest matchPercentages` (deterministic tiebreak: builder > innovator > architect)
3. `primaryRole = ARCHETYPE_TO_ROLE[primaryArchetype]`
4. `ranking = ['builder', 'innovator', 'architect'] sorted desc by matchPercentages`

### Properties to test

- All-keep produces 100/100/100 (saturation case)
- All-pass produces 0/0/0
- A user keeping only Builder-3 items produces high Builder, low others
- The function is pure (same input always produces same output, no global state read or written)
- It handles missing decisions for unsorted items by treating them as `'pass'`

### Tuning notes

The pass-equals-zero rule means a picky user can produce all-low scores honestly ("you haven't given us much signal yet for any of these"). The design should handle this gracefully on the results screen rather than the scoring engine artificially inflating numbers. Schema supports negative weights for later experiments; default v1 has no negative weights.

## 10. Robot assembly

Lives in `/src/lib/robotAssembly.ts`. Pure function.

### Signature

```ts
export function assembleRobot(
  decisions: Record<string, Decision>,
  items: InterestItem[],
  primaryArchetype: ArchetypeId | null
): RobotState;
```

### Algorithm

1. Initialize an empty `RobotState` with `isFinalized: false` and a default base/body/colorScheme.
2. For each item kept (`decisions[id] === 'keep'`), in item order:
   - For each `RobotPartRef` in that item's `robotContribution.parts`:
     - For single-cardinality slots: assign `partId` (overwrite previous).
     - For multi-cardinality slots (`accessory`, `decal`): append `partId` to the array, respecting the cap.
3. Set `colorScheme` from `primaryArchetype` (or default if null).
4. Return the state. `isFinalized` is set to `true` by the caller only at the Build beat.

### Live-build semantics

During sorting (Phase 2+), `assembleRobot` is called after every decision so the user sees the robot accrete in real time. On completion, the screen transitions to the Build beat which finalizes the state (`isFinalized: true`) and the snap-into-place animation plays.

If the user bails (closes, navigates away, refreshes) before completion, no robot is persisted. No half-robot leaves the experience.

## 11. Program selection

Lives in `/src/lib/programSelection.ts`. Given a role the user is "trying on," pick the most relevant programs.

### Signature

```ts
export function selectProgramsForRole(
  roleId: RoleId,
  programs: TrainingProgram[],
  options?: { max?: number }
): TrainingProgram[];
```

### Algorithm (v1, simple)

1. Filter `programs` to those whose `rolesServed` includes `roleId`.
2. Sort by number of competency matches with the role's `competencyIds` (descending), then by type preference (apprenticeship/certificate > bootcamp > degree for the HS audience).
3. Return top `max` (default 3).

The team can replace this scoring later. Keep it dumb in v1.

## 12. Session state

Lives in a Zustand store at `/src/state/sessionStore.ts`. Exposes:

```ts
interface SessionStore {
  state: SessionState;
  startSession: () => void;
  recordDecision: (itemId: string, decision: Decision) => void;
  advanceRound: () => void;
  completeSorting: () => void;     // triggers scoring, finalizes robot
  tryOnRole: (roleId: RoleId) => void;
  toggleSound: () => void;
  reset: () => void;
}
```

Conventions:

- `recordDecision` calls `assembleRobot` and updates the live (non-finalized) robot state.
- `completeSorting` runs `calculateScores`, sets `scoreResult`, sets `primaryRole`, sets `currentlyTryingOn` to the primary role by default, and marks `robot.isFinalized = true`.
- No persistence in v1. State lives in memory; refreshing the page starts fresh. The reset behavior is intentional for the prototype.

## 13. File layout

```
/src/data
  types.ts              All TypeScript interfaces
  items.ts              The 24 InterestItem objects

```

Tests for the three lib functions live in `/src/lib/__tests__/`. They run as part of the standard `pnpm test` and are independent of Playwright.

## 14. Tuning surface

What's expected to change without code edits:

- **Any text:** item labels, role descriptions, plain-name competency translations, job descriptions, program blurbs.
- **All archetype weights** in `items.ts`. This is the primary scoring tuning surface.
- **A whole question set** (section 16): set B's items, weights, robot mappings, and owned copy are authored in `questionSets/setB.ts` via the data-author skill — no component edits.
- **Robot part assignments** per item (which partId each item references).
- **Mock training programs** added, removed, or edited freely.

What requires a code edit:

- Adding a fourth archetype or role (don't do this).
- Changing scoring algorithm shape.
- Adding new robot slots.
- Changing session state shape.

If a content change feels like it needs a code edit, stop and ask. It probably doesn't, and the convention is what keeps the team's iteration cheap.

## 15. Sanity checks before considering this doc "applied"

When `/src/data` is scaffolded from this doc, verify:

- All 24 items exist with all three weights set (no missing zeros). _(Per question set — see section 16.)_
- Sum-per-archetype across all items matches the set's **declared `expectedSums`** (Set A: Builder 22, Innovator 27, Architect 25). Sums are recomputed from live items and compared against the declaration, per set.
- Every role's `competencyIds` array is non-empty and references real entries in `competencies.ts`.
- Every program references real role IDs and real competency IDs.
- Every item's `robotContribution.parts` references real entries in `robotParts.ts` (placeholders fine; the references must resolve).
- A unit test confirms `calculateScores` on an all-keep input returns 100/100/100.
- A unit test confirms `calculateScores` on an all-pass input returns 0/0/0.
- A unit test confirms `calculateScores` returns the expected primary archetype for a representative builder-heavy input.

## 16. Question sets (A/B language test)

Added 2026-06-04 for the first user test (see `DECISIONS.md` D-016; flagged in `PRD.md` §8/§14). The test compares two language treatments — formal/exam-like vs playful/narrativized — so the content the user reads ships as two swappable **question sets**.

### The QuestionSet shape

```ts
interface QuestionSet {
  id: QuestionSetId;            // 'a' | 'b'
  name: string;                 // researcher-facing label on the landing switcher
  items: InterestItem[];        // its own 24 — own ids, labels, weights, robot mappings
  rounds: RoundMeta[];          // its own round-transition copy
  sortCopy: SortCopy;           // bin labels + drag hint
  landingCopy: LandingCopy;     // overline, heading, description, CTA
  resultsCopy: ResultsCopy;     // heading, compare hint, retake, low-signal, sections, fit bands
  expectedSums: ArchetypeWeights; // declared per-archetype sums; tests assert declared == computed
}
```

### What a set owns vs what stays shared

- **Set-owned:** the 24 interest items (ids, labels, weights, robot-part mappings), round copy, sort-screen copy, landing copy, results copy. The whole experience reads in one voice per set.
- **Shared (never per-set):** roles, competencies, essential skills, training programs, the robot-part catalog, color schemes, and the scoring algorithm. The three-role taxonomy is a hard rule.

### Invariants (enforced per set by `data-integrity.test.ts`)

- 24 items, 6 per round, all three weights present (0–3), every robot-part reference resolves.
- Recomputed per-archetype sums equal the set's **declared** `expectedSums`. Sets need not match each other — scoring normalizes each archetype against its own max, per set.
- Item ids unique within a set **and across sets** (decisions are keyed by item id; set B uses a `b-` prefix).
- All owned copy non-empty; 4 round entries covering rounds 1–4.

### Runtime model

- The registry lives in `questionSets/index.ts`; `defaultSetId` is `'a'`.
- The session store holds `questionSetId` **next to** session state, not inside it — `reset()` ("Start over") replaces only the session, so the researcher's chosen condition survives between participants. The landing switcher calls `selectQuestionSet`.
- Store actions resolve the active set's items at action time; screens read copy via the `useQuestionSet()` hook. Only one set is ever active in a session.

### Status (superseded for the live study)

The formal-vs-playful A/B was **superseded by the question-structure study** (§17, `DECISIONS.md` D-017) before set B's content was authored. Set B and the `b-` cross-set machinery are removed; `QuestionSetId` is now just `'a'` and `questionSetList` holds only set A. The QuestionSet shape itself survives intact: the **classic** flow wraps set A by reference (§17), so the Phase 1 interest-sort pipeline is unchanged. `QUESTION_SET_WORKSHEET.md` is retained as a historical artifact but is no longer the live authoring path.

## 17. Flows (question-structure study)

Added 2026-06-07 for the first user test (see `DECISIONS.md` D-017; flagged in `PRD.md`). The test compares which **question structure** is most engaging and produces the most trusted results. Three selectable flows ship on one build; a researcher-facing segmented control on Landing switches between them per participant.

The original A/B (§16) assumed both conditions shared one flow shape (24-item sort → build → 3-archetype results). The study breaks that: the two new flows have different step structures, score **four** RC.org categories instead of three archetypes, and share a new results experience. So `QuestionSet` grew a sibling: the **flow**.

### The three flows

| Flow | `kind` | Shape | Results |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Classic** | `classic` | The Phase 1 experience, wrapping set A by reference. | 3 role cards (archetype pipeline, unchanged) |
| **Narrative** | `narrative` | 5 intro MC questions (Q1 branches), then 7 day-in-the-life **scenes**; each scene's 4 choices are sorted into the 3 buckets, one card at a time (D-018). | category node map |
| **Exam** | `exam` | 2 background MC + 1 mapped MC, then a **30-statement sort** into 3 buckets. | category node map |

### The four categories

The study flows score `CategoryId = 'operate' | 'repair' | 'program' | 'plan'`, each mapped to a role: Operate→Operator, Repair→Technician, Program→Specialist, Plan→Integrator. This is **parallel to, not an extension of**, the three-archetype model — `ArchetypeId`/`RoleId`/`ARCHETYPE_TO_ROLE` and the classic pipeline are untouched. The new fourth role (Operator) exists only in the category world, and the results screen renders entirely from new `roleDetails` data (keyed by `CategoryId`), so `roles.ts` and the "exactly three role families" rule are not violated for the classic experience. See the CLAUDE.md hard-rule carve-out.

### Shapes

```ts
type Flow = ClassicFlow | CategoryFlow;
interface ClassicFlow { kind: 'classic'; id; name; landingCopy; questionSet: QuestionSet; }
interface CategoryFlow {
  kind: 'narrative' | 'exam'; id; name; landingCopy;
  steps: FlowStep[];                 // discriminated by `type`
  expectedCategoryMax: CategoryWeights; // declared full-path ceiling; tests assert == computed
  resultsCopy: FlowResultsCopy;      // node-map + role-sheet chrome
}
type FlowStep = MCStep | SceneStep | StatementSortStep;
// MCStep: optional prompt, question, choices[] — each choice maps to 0+ categories
//   (0 = unscored background) and may carry branchTo (a step id; Q1 "No" skips Q2).
// SceneStep: prompt + question + exactly 4 choices, one per category. Each choice is
//   sorted into a bucket (like a statement), recorded in statementBuckets by choice id.
// StatementSortStep: 30 statements (order fixed in data, interleaved) + 3 buckets.
// Buckets (shared SORT_BUCKETS, both flows): thats-me "That's me" / maybe "Kinda me" /
//   not-me "Not me". The middle label is "Kinda me" (D-018); its id stays `maybe`.
interface CategoryResult { raw; matchPercentages; ranking; primaryCategory; } // CategoryWeights
```

### Scoring (`lib/categoryScoring.ts` — pure, mirrors §9)

`calculateCategoryScores(flow, answers, statementBuckets)` walks the **path the answers actually took** (branch-aware: a skipped Q2 contributes to neither raw nor max), tallying per category: each scored MC choice, each scene choice, and each statement adds 1 to its category's `max`. For `raw`, a scored MC choice adds 1 to each category it maps to (a two-category choice feeds both); **scene choices and statements are bucketed** — `thats-me` → 1, `maybe` (the "Kinda me" middle bucket) → `MAYBE_WEIGHT` (a tunable constant, **0** today — the prior study asked for a middle option but the team wants it scored as a no for now, D-018), `not-me`/unanswered → 0. Because a scene's four choices are each bucketed independently, one scene can credit several categories or none (unlike the old single-pick). Each category normalizes against its own max; `ranking` is sorted desc with the stable `operate > repair > program > plan` tiebreak.

### Results — one per flow (the study compares presentations too)

Each new flow has its **own** results presentation; they share the `categoryResult` data and the role-detail **sheet**, not the layout.

- **Narrative → node map** (`Results/category/`): an Obsidian-style node graph (the earlier concentric rings read as "funky" — redesigned). The top-matched role sits front-and-center; the other three sit behind it (arced above, faded). Tapping a behind-node swaps it into the center (Motion `layout`); the heading names the centered role ("Your top match" vs "You're exploring"). The active role's `commonJobTitles` branch off the front on hairline connectors (`fanPoints` arcs them down); tap a title for the role sheet.
- **Exam → dashboard** (`Results/exam/`): a robot anchor (static `RobotPlaceholder`, tinted by the top category via `CATEGORY_ACCENT_TEXT`) + four category **bars**; then **"Why you scored that way"** (score provenance from `categoryContributions` — the items you said yes to, n of m, walking the same path the scorer did) and **"Your roles"** (top-2 ranked → the role sheet).
- **Shared role sheet** (`category/RoleDetailSheet`): the RC.org role-card content (description, activities, education, titles, salary) + a stub "Add this Role to your profile" link + a four-axis **fit radar** of the user's category percentages. Opened with a specific job title (node map) or on the role itself (exam "your roles" — `jobTitle` omitted).
- `Results.tsx` dispatches three ways by `flow.kind`: classic → `ClassicResults`, narrative → node map, exam → dashboard.

### Robot build: skipped (this iteration)

Both new flows **skip the robot build + build beat** — the study keeps presentation minimal so participants focus on the questions. Category flows never touch `robot` state and never route through `/build`. Re-enabling later is a per-flow `'build'` step or flag routed through `/build`; documented, not built.

### Runtime model

- Registry: `flows/index.ts` (`flows`, `flowList` ordered Narrative/Exam/Classic, `defaultFlowId` = `'classic'`). The store holds `flowId` **next to** session state (same survives-`reset()` mechanism as §16's `questionSetId`). The landing switcher calls `selectFlow`; the CTA routes by kind (`classic` → `/sort`, else → `/flow`).
- `FlowRunner` (`/flow`) renders the current step by type and advances via `recordAnswer`/`recordStatement`/`advanceStep`/`completeFlow`; navigation is declarative off `currentScreen` so completion can't race the redirect. `/results` dispatches to `ClassicResults` or `CategoryResults` by kind.

### Invariants (enforced per flow by `data-integrity.test.ts`)

- Narrative: exactly 7 scenes, each with 4 choices covering all four categories; every `branchTo` resolves forward; computed full-path category max equals declared `expectedCategoryMax`.
- Exam: exactly 30 statements counted 8/7/7/8 (operate/repair/program/plan), interleaved (no two adjacent share a category), the 3 shared `SORT_BUCKETS` in order (`thats-me`/`maybe`/`not-me`) with the middle label asserted as "Kinda me" (D-018).
- Both: unique step + choice + statement ids; all owned copy non-empty; four `roleDetails` resolve to four distinct role names.

### Screener fit (D-020)

The initial screener questions also produce an **always-on fit line** on results (`Results/category/FitNote`), separate from the match score. Each role carries an `educationLevel` and `payLevel` (0/1/2) in `roleDetails`. `lib/screenerFit.ts` (pure) `deriveScreenerProfile(flowId, answers)` reads the user's school/pay appetite (0/1/2) off the screener answers — exam Q1 directly; narrative Q1+Q2 for education, Q3 for pay — and `screenerFitLines(category, profile)` compares it to the role in focus, returning a line per axis: **green check** when appetite ≥ the role's level, **amber heads-up** when the role needs more school / pays a tier below the user's target. Education shows in both flows; pay is narrative-only. Levels + copy are data (`src/data/flows/screeners.ts`). Shown next to the top match (exam) / centered role (narrative).

### Open item

Background-question mapping is **partly recovered**: the **exam** Q1/Q2 now nudge the match on a tier ladder (No→Operator, Maybe/Yes→Specialist+Integrator — "not planning" vs "open to it", D-019; max {operate 11, repair 8, program 10, plan 11}), and the 0/1/2 screener appetites feed the fit line (D-020). The exam **salary** isn't asked; the narrative salary stays fit-line-only (no score nudge). The **narrative** intro questions (Q1 college, Q2 how-long, Q3 salary) remain **unmapped for scoring** — they drive the fit line via their answers but carry empty `MCChoice.categories`. Adding their score weights later is a data edit. See D-017, D-019, D-020.
