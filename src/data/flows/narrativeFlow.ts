// The Narrative flow (DATA_MODEL §17): six intro questions, then a day-in-the-life story in
// seven scenes. Scores ARM's three robotics roles — Technician (entry), Specialist (mid),
// Integrator (planning). Content from docs/reference/Narrative Quiz Structure Content Spec.md
// (three-role re-cut, Phase 5 / D-028), grounded in the role salaries + education in
// docs/reference/ARM Updated Role Structure - Source Content.md.
//
// Q0 (experience) is an unscored background question (routing parked for later).
// Education (Q1 "college?" + Q2 "how long?") and salary (Q3) nudge the score on the role
// tier ladder — one point each (D-023): no college / $45k → technician; 4+ years / $85k+ →
// specialist + integrator. "1-2 years" is deliberately UNSCORED — it sits between the entry
// Technician (HS/GED) and the degreed roles (Bachelor's), matching no role, which also keeps
// the three role ceilings equal at 11. Q2 "Whatever" stays unscored too. These tags are a
// parallel signal to the screener fit line (flows/screeners.ts), kept consistent with its
// levels but not merged. Q4 and Q5 each map one choice per role.
