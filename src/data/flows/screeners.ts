// Screener appetite levels + fit-line copy for the results "fit check" (D-020).
//
// The initial screener questions in each flow gauge how much school / pay the user is
// after: 0 = least, 1 = some, 2 = most. lib/screenerFit.ts derives that appetite from the
// answers and compares it to the matched role's ladder (roleDetails educationLevel /
// payLevel) to show an always-on fit line. This is content — tune the levels and copy
// here without touching the fit logic.

/** Per-answer appetite level for the single-question axes. Narrative education combines
 *  Q1 ("going to college?") with Q2 ("how long?") — that combination lives in
 *  screenerFit.ts, which reads the Q2 levels below. These are the user's school/pay
 *  appetite for the fit line; the category score is a separate signal (e.g. "1-2 years"
 *  carries an appetite here but is unscored as a category — D-028). */
/** The narrative steps that gauge school/pay appetite (the results breakdown's "openers":
 *  education = Q1/Q2, pay = Q3). Centralized here so screenerFit and categoryBreakdown agree
 *  on which scored steps are screeners vs. interest/scene "moments". */
